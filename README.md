Made during Hackverse 2024

Apticket seamlessly integrates the purchase of tickets across various entertainment domains by leveraging the power of tokenization. Our platform generates personalized fungible tokens for each ticket, revolutionizing the ticketing industry and combating issues such as black market ticket sales and scalping.

Our pitch to event organizers highlights the benefits of adopting Apticket under their terms of service and conditions. With Apticket, users can purchase tickets for a wide range of events including sports, movies, concerts, and more using either the Petra Wallet or the Aptos blockchain network.

Upon purchase, each ticket transforms into a fungible token, ensuring authenticity and preventing manipulation. These fungible tokens can then be traded on our marketplace, where prices are determined by a fixed algorithm, eliminating exorbitant ticket prices.

In cases of genuine emergencies or unavailability, users have the option to sell their fungible tokens, transferring ownership to a buyer after a validated purchase. We've meticulously studied potential loopholes and fraud mechanisms, implementing a mechanism to prevent duplicate transaction IDs. Each transaction is directly mapped to the sender's address, ensuring secure transactions and accurate record-keeping. Event managers receive precise transaction records, which can be used for verification during the respective event.

Join us as we redefine the ticketing experience with Apticket and revolutionize the way you experience entertainment
